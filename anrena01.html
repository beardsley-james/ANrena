  <div id="DeckList"><p>Arena is a drafting format where a series of cards is presented to you. Each card you pick is added to your deck. 
  This generator has a certain set of constraints that will lead to a legal deck with a minimum number of essentials.</p>
  <p>Start by picking your side. Try to make the best deck you can. And then go over to jinteki.net to find a partner. Enjoy!</p>
